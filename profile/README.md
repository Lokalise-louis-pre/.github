## Louis PRE Organisation

This organisation aims to create and delete repos with storybook builds generated from our [Louis contributors](https://github.com/lokalise/louis) pull requests. Those builds are uploaded to their own github pages environment as described [here](https://github.com/lokalise/louis/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#3-preview-deployment-links) so contributors can visually preview their storybook changes.
